## Summary

For this project we hope to analyze the happiness of numerous countries and compare this data
to other statistics from those countries in an attempt to identify any links between the happiness
of the population and various other data.
**World Happiness Report** ​ — Displays the average happiness of the population as a score out
of 10, as well as ranking the various countries polled.
This data set would need very minimal cleaning as it is already organised efficiently. Though
grouping by region may allow for more analysis, so some cleaning is required there.
**WHO Suicide Statistics** ​— This data describes the number of deaths due to self-harm for both
sexes. We have obtained it using the WHO Mortality Database Online Tool. The data generated
is from the count of homeless people from 141 countries for 2015, 2016, and the most recent
year since not all countries had a stat for the specified year.
**International Migrants and Refugees** ​ — The International Migrants and Refugees fact sheet
off of the data.un.org website lists many countries and their stats, the most relevant being total
refugee and asylum seekers. Each country, region and/or area has the last four to five years
worth of data listed with 2018 being the most recent. Our challenge will be to assess which
categories are most fit to be combined with our main data and to convert it into an appropriate
measure.

## Goals

Initial analysis will seek to find which factor of the “World Happiness Report” data set impacts
happiness ranking the most, and trying to see if one is able to predict a happiness score based
off of various important data, such as GDP, Life expectancy and Freedom. Futher analysis
would delve into the suicide rates of these countries, attempting to see if lower happiness
scores result in higher suicide rates using the dataset of “WHO Suicide Statistics”. We will also
attempt to look at other datasets for these countries such as homelessness rates and retirement
ages to see if these have a correlation with happiness.


## Techniques

The use of basic analysis tools such as histograms, scatter plots and summary statistics. We
will also use more advanced techniques such as regression analysis and clustering to answer
questions such as what impacts the most on happiness as well as whether or not suicide rates
could be predicted based on these factors.

## Project Plan

**Milestone One** ​ — Properly combining all datasets into one complete set. This combination of
data sets should be completely accurate to allow for proper analysis of key points. Evaluating
the extent of our success on this milestone would be done through examining whether the
combined data reflects similar data to the separate data sets.
**Milestone Two** ​ — Completion of basic data analysis on the combined data sets, using
foundation techniques such as histograms, scatter plots and summary statistics. This initial
analysis would form an essential foundation of future analysis as well as the groundwork of
Milestone three. The success of this milestone will be determined when we are able to
understand the combination of all data sets, this is an essential step in needed further analysis.
**Milestone Three** ​ — Using the data analysis to identify any correlations and prediction models
between the variables of the combined dataset. Justify or invalidate any links identified. In this
stage we will potentially train models that can predict rates given the data, assuming that any
significant correlations are identified.
